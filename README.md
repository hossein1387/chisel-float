# A basic chisel project

This is based on [chisel-float](https://github.com/zhemao/chisel-float) repository. The original 
repository was set up to use Chisel2 where in this repo, I tried to use Chisel3 conventions. 

To use this repository, first clone it:

    git clone https://github.com/hossein1387/chisel-float
    git checkout --track origin/chisel_3_mod
